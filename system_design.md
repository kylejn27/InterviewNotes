More of a system design doc template than interview notes, but might be helpful regardless
 
## Problem Statement
- Current problem in the system
- what is the customer need that this design meets

## Objective
- What is this project and how does this project solve the problem at hand

## Design/Project Tenants
- Are there any tenants that we want to follow as a team for this project?

## Assumptions
- What assumptions are being made in the requirements and how will these assumptions affect the design if the assumption is wrong

## Unknowns/Pending Research (optional)

## Requirements
- Link requirements document here if exists

### Functional Requirements
These are user stories and use cases
- Specifications for what the system must do
- Business rules that must be met
- Authentication steps

- Capacity
- Reliability
- Extensibility
- Error handling

## Out of Scope
- Lower priority requirements that do not need to be built int this design.
  - Still need to be considered so the deisng doesn't require major refactoring if needed to include

## Impact to Existing Systems
- What systems if any will this project impact? How will we account for this impact
- Backwards compatibility concerns

### Upcoming related features?
- Will this be reliant or relied upon by any upcoming features currently in development?
